DFPlayer USE Matrix

What happens if one wants more than two DFPlayers?  Under DCC-EX EX-Command Station, serial port expansion is an option but requires the help of the I2C bus with several additional hardware considerations.  

The DFPlayer has three operating modes; 
Serial Communications
Direct I/O
Loop

Commonly available positive level triggered opto-isolated relay boards designed to be driven by MCUs can simulate both short and long momentary button depressions or a latching switch.  Solid State Relays and sensors can also be employed.

Assuming the sound object requires only one or few different clips, operating the DFPlayer in either Direct I/O mode or Loop mode can be a viable alternative.  There are instances where one or two clips Is all that’s necessary for a given detail.  In Loop mode, a single audio clip playing the sound(s) of burning wood in concert with the respective associated campfire lighting detail can work well and save the MCU’s serial ports for sound objects that require many clips, regardless of order and at a variety of volume levels.

Order
The file naming convention suggested is 0001xyz.mp3 , 0002abc.mp3, 0003def.mp3 and so on.  While this is helpful in matching clips and how they are noted in code, technically the DFPlayer uses the order on which they were copied to the micro SD card.  It is the sequential entry into the disk’s FAT or File allocation table that dictates the physical clip order.  Therefore, the first clip copied to the SD card is the first FAT entry, and so on.  Important.  Clips must be copied ONE at a time in sequential order.  If you copy 0003def.mp3 before 0001xyz.mp3, 0003.mp3 IS THE First Clip as far as the DFPlayer is concerned!  Remember, the Windows Copy command DOES NOT place the clips in order if multiple files are selected and copied to the SD Card at the same time.

File Naming and Order Example
Below shows the first three of the 26 Tower sound clips.  They were copied one by one to a micro SD Card.

Introduction to the DFPlayer – An Overview
The DFPlayer is an inexpensive and simple device for incorporating sound objects or details on any model railroad.  While many incorporate it in serial communications mode with a Microcontroller (MCU), the DFPlayer other two operating modes allow it to be easily added on traditional model layouts too!
